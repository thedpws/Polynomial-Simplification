# Polynomial Sumplification
# Aeyzechiah Vasquez and Joey Lu

# How to Run
Run the following code to test the program against the tests:
```bash
make tests
```
There may be many warnings that can be ignored.
The output will be produced in the .out files within the tests directory.
Some of the names of the functions from the skeleton code have been changed but should not effect how the program runs.

## Features Implemented
* Addition, subtraction, and multiplication of polynomials can be handled 
* Distribution between polynomials has also been implemented
* This program can only handle integers, does not perform division between polynomials, and can not handle negative exponents
